Octobot
============

A Telegram Bot (FORK) based on [Yagop's Telegram Bot](http://git.io/6jdjGg).

Enable more [`plugins`](https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/tree/master/plugins)
-------------
See the plugins list with `!plugins` command.

Enable a disabled plugin by `!plugins enable [name]`.

Disable an enabled plugin by `!plugins disable [name]`.

Those commands require a privileged user, privileged users are defined inside `data/config.lua` (generated by the bot), stop the bot and edit if necessary, or ask a sudo user to add you.


Working on a fork?
-----------------

The process to ensure your repo doesn't collide when making a feature/bugfix is simple.
Assuming you already have the repository checked out from YOUR fork... do the following

    git checkout master
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/chuckbutler/telegram-bot.git
    git pull upstream master
    git push origin master
    git checkout -b my-feature
    *hack hack hack*
    git push origin my-feature

now open a pull request targeting master, and someone will be along shortly to
evaluate your contribution.

Thanks for caring enough to share and help make Octobot better!
